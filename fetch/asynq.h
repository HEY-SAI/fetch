 AsynQ
 -----

 This is a thread-safe asynchronous queue.  It can be used from multiple threads
 without explicit locking.

 The implementation wraps a FIFO queue implemented on a circular store of
 pointers that address distinct, pre-allocated buffers.  

 There are three basic operations: pop, push and peek. Push and pop use a swap
 operation that exchanges the pointer to a token buffer with the pointer to the
 head/tail.  On a push, the input buffer has been filled with data to enqueue.
 On a pop, the input buffer is just a place holder; the contained data may be
 deleted or overwritten.

 The only operation that initiates a blocking copy of an enqueued buffer is
 peek.  Peek copies data from the tail buffer to an input buffer.
 
 Peeking and popping block when the queue is empty.  On termination, if no data
 is being pushed on, waiting consumers will become deadlocked.  There are two
 mechanisms provided for dealing with this:

   1.  Flush waiting consumers by triggering the notify_data event until there
       are no more waiting consumers.  Pops and peeks will return indicating
       failure because they double check the queue state after they're notified.

   2.  Use *_Timed functions. These will indicate failure via the return value.
   
 The one to use depends on the situation.  Flushing all waiting consumers is
 really designed to be performed on shutdown after waiting for threads to
 terminate (with a timeout).  The flush will ensure that consumer threads can
 unblock and exit normally, giving them a chance to release resources.

 Notes to self:
 ..............
 - This seems very similar in intention to the SwapChain in DirectX10.

 Return values:
 -------------
 Where applicable:
  1 indicates Success
  0 indicates Failure
