/* Task
 * ----
 *
 * A Task instance should not carry any permanent state.  This class defines an
 * associated set of callbacks used by an Agent.
 *
 * When a Task instance is not part of a running Agent, it has no guaranteed
 * lifetime.
 *
 * The Task::config() function is called by the Agent::arm() function and is
 * responsible for setting up resources for the Task::run() function.
 * Task::run() is called by the Task::thread_main() function when an
 * associated Agent is transitioned to the Run state.  Task::run() acts like
 * the task's main loop and should terminate when the Agent::notify_stop event
 * is set, if not before.
 *
 * The Agent state model guarantees calls to Task::run() will follow calls to
 * Task::config().  However, config() may be called several times (by cycling
 * Agent arm's and disarm's) before run() is called.  Persistent resources
 * used by a task should be allocated in the Agent during the attach/detach
 * routines.

   *
   * An additional update() function is provided to supplement the config()
   * function.
   *
   * config() is intended to be used to set up the entire set of resources
   * required for a task.  However, in some applications, a subset of those
   * resources are frequently updated.  The update() function provided here
   * allows one to implement less expensive updates for frequently changed
   * resources.
   *
   * update() is only called while the associated Agent is in an Armed state.
