# Tcp Protocol for controlling fetch

## Basics

The server read/writes Utf8 encoded strings terminated with `\r\n`.

A command looks like:

    <cmd> <arg0> <arg1> ... <argn>

Most commands have no arguments.

The system will not respond to any commands until the "version0" command is specified.

That command is intended to select for a command set.  Currently there is only one,
but one can imaging that might change in the future.

## Commands

version0     -- enables processing of commands on the connection
help         -- returns the list of commands
status       -- returns a string indicating the currently armed task and the state (running or stopped)
run          -- commands the microscope to start the current task
stop         -- commands the microscope to stop                                                     
arm <task>   -- commands the microscope to arm a new task
tasks        -- The list of armable tasks.

## More information

Currently, the entire implementation is in src/ui/MicroscopeTcpServerDockWidget.cpp
